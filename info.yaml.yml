For each IRNode:
  1) Resolve element:
    - try primary selector → if not visible, scroll-until-visible
    - if fail → try alternates (text/role/attrs)
    - if fail → visual_match(thumbnail) → compute new selector (patch)
  2) Perform action:
    - click / fill (resolve inputs: static vars or n8n secrets)
    - downloads: intercept, wait for file
  3) Verify:
    - URL change / element presence / file exists / screenshot diff threshold
  4) Capture proof:
    - thumbnail + short log; upload to /proofs
  5) Detect interrupts:
    - CAPTCHA widget? → pause, notify, resume on user signal
    - OTP field? → request via WhatsApp → fill → continue
